# Data Access Object DAO Test

Another code written while training Data Base Access using Java, JDBC API and MySQL Data Base Server, implementing the concepts of Data Access Object (DAO) learned in the 'Java Completo Programação Orientada a Objetos' Course at Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/course/java-curso-completo/).
The data on data base server was modified by myself when compared whit data inside 'demo-dao-jdbc2' repository.
